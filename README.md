Analysis of the Relationship between Trout Condition in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park

## The Purpose of the Project
### This project addresses three main questions related to Fulton fish condition factor for trout in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
#### 1. How has the fish condition changed over time at 18 locations in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park?
#### 2. Is there a statistically significant relationship between trout condition and acid neutralizing capacity(ANC) in streams of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park?
#### 3.  Is there a significant difference in K for allopatric vs. sympatric brook trout populations of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park?

## These are the Technologies Used for the Project
#### 1. Excel - Initial data exploration and cleaning
#### 2. Python with Jupyter Notebook - Data cleaning, data merging, data analysis
#### 3. Tableau - Creation of data story, including multiple dashboards with graphs and trendlines
#### 4. GitHub - Project version management and documentation
